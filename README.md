#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software enginnering isthe establishment and use of sound engineeirng techniques to create a high quality software that is reliable and works efficiently
importance of software engineeirng is that it ensures high quality softtware are developed. It also facilitates automation of most operations thus saving on time.
also fix bugs on apps ensure smooth running without any glitch.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.idea generation- one comes up with an idea of a project that he/she wants to work on
2. requirement analysis- one assesses the resources that he will need for the project
3.product design- developer comes up with a sketch of how the end product should like
4.product development- developer gets into developing the product based on the design he had
5.integration and testing- developer is able to test if the product is working efficiently and fixes any errors detected
6.deployment- the developer launches the product in to the market
maintenance- from time to time the developer fixes any bugs that may arise


  Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   Approach → Waterfall follows a linear, sequential process, while Agile uses an iterative, incremental approach.

 Flexibility → Waterfall is rigid and difficult to change once the project starts, whereas Agile allows flexibility and continuous adjustments.

 Project Size → Waterfall is best for large, well-defined projects, while Agile is suitable for dynamic projects with evolving requirements.

Testing → In Waterfall, testing happens after development is complete, whereas Agile integrates testing throughout the development cycle.

5 Customer Involvement → Waterfall requires minimal client involvement after the initial planning, while Agile involves continuous customer feedback.

6Delivery → Waterfall delivers the final product at the end, whereas Agile releases frequent, smaller updates.

7 Risk Management → Waterfall has higher risks due to late-stage testing, while Agile minimizes risks by detecting issues early.

8 Documentation → Waterfall relies on extensive documentation, while Agile focuses more on collaboration and adaptability.

When to Use Each Methodology
-Waterfall is ideal for structured projects with fixed requirements, such as government systems or medical records software.
- Agile works best for evolving projects like mobile apps or tech startups, where continuous updates are needed. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software Developer- Writes and maintains software.

Develops clean and efficient code.
Fixes bugs and optimizes performance.
Collaborates with designers and testers.

2. Quality Assurance Engineer-Ensures software quality.

Designs and executes test cases.
Identifies and reports bugs.
Automates testing processes.

3.Project Manager-Oversees project execution.

Plans timelines, budgets, and resources.
Manages team communication and progress.
Mitigates risks and ensures timely delivery.









Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
version contro systems enable one to keep track of hte changes that are made on the code . example is Git.
Integrated Development Environments are softwares that provides tools for writing, editing, debugging, and testing code in one environment.E.g visual studio code

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging and Fixing Complex Bugs → Use debugging tools, follow a systematic approach, and apply rubber duck debugging.

Managing Technical Debt → Prioritize code refactoring, follow best practices, and use automated tests.

 Keeping Up with Rapidly Changing Technology → Continuously learn through online courses, coding communities, and tech conferences.

Handling Tight Deadlines → Use agile methodologies, prioritize tasks effectively, and set realistic expectations
Balancing Feature Development and Performance Optimization → Use profiling tools, implement caching, and conduct load testing.

Working in a Team with Different Skill Levels → Encourage pair programming, code reviews, and knowledge sharing.

Security Vulnerabilities and Cyber Threats → Follow secure coding practices, update dependencies, and perform penetration testing.

Maintaining Work-Life Balance → Set boundaries, use task management tools, and take regular breaks.










Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of a software application to ensure they work correctly in isolation. important in catching bugs early in development
Integration testing examines how different modules or services within a system interact with each other. identifies issuees in module interactions
System testing evaluates the entire application as a whole to verify that it meets functional and non-functional requirements
Acceptance testing verifies if the software meets the specified business requirements and is ready for release. this ensures that the software meets the customer needs and requirements


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing input prompts to effectively guide AI models (such as ChatGPT) in generating accurate, relevant, and useful responses
it is important in enhancing the quality of response one receives, reduces ambiguity thus enhancing clear understadning by the AI model and also improves efficiency.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt- explain what software engineering is?
improved version-Provide a detailed explanation of software engineering, including its definition, key principles, and real-world applications."
the improved prompt is more effective as it clearly states the information that I want to be included in my response and improves efficiency of the AI model as it works within clearly defined bounds
